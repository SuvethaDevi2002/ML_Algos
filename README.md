**COMPARING VARYING ACCURACIES IN DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS**

A training and testing dataset has been taken, And it got trained with various ML models such as, 

1. KNN
2. Linear regression
3. Logistic regression
4. Random forest


and compared accuracies resulted from these in testing
